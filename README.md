# Goal-Scoring
Some analysis in to what goes in to scoring goals in the NHL. 

This is some rudimentary analsysis in to how shots on net affects goal scoring in the NHL.
This analysis is done by Cal Burke a current pro hockey player intended for other high level hockey players, coaches and management. 
The idea is to provide analysis from someone who understands both the analytics and what it's like playing the game. At this intersection is 
the unique ability to articulate findings in an actionable and understandable way. 

This file is the introductory to goal scoring analysis in the NHL. It is strictly a starting point. It is simple on purpose. Often analysis is 
too complex that it becomes difficult to decipher, inactionable and rooted in theory rather practicality.  

Please forgive the inelegant code... I'm working on it.
